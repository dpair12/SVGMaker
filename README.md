## SVG-Maker

## Project Description

This project is a representation of my current knowledge of nodejs and object oriented programming. Using the Challenge 10 ReadME as a guide, I created a SVG Maker application that uses the inquirer node module, constructor classes, inheritance, and more. The way the application works is by entering node index.js into the terminal, a prompt of questions appear that takes user input to create their SVG file.  The input data is passed into the Shapes constructor class once it has been captured and depending on what type of shape the user selects, a new SVG is created with that Shape and inherits the structure of the Shapes constructor class. Upon the SVG being created, a message will display in the terminal stating 'Succesfully generated logo.svg!' and the logo.svg file is saved within the dist folder. 

Note: The user can only select from three SVG shapes (Triangle, Circle, and Square).

## Tests

The tests I had to perform include passing input data from inquirer node module into Shapes constructor class, creating a SVG based on the type of shape the user selects by creating conditional statements, and ensuring that all classes used are properly exported.
